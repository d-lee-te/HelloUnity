Added:

- Problems
: Details what problems I've encountered and how I'm troubleshooting them
- Changelog
: Added a changelog because commenting may leave history, but this is easier to read the description of and keep a log of.

Progress:
- Finished pt.1 & pt.2 of tutorial
: I've done this stuff once before, so it's not as bad just repeating the steps. The first time around took me longer since I actually had to watch the video and understand what he was saying, but repeating it a second time just became steps.
