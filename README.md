Hello world! BUT UNITY! :D

I'll be following this tutorial and I'll see if it guides me well: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL
If it's successful, I'll have a nice little game.
I remember trying to use this to rig my model for vrchat. That wasn't fun.
I also need to remember to format my readmes to look more readable at some point.
