# First-Unity-Game
Hello world! BUT UNITY! :D

I'll be following this tutorial and I'll see if it guides me well: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL

If it's successful, I'll have a nice little game.
I remember trying to use this to rig my model for vrchat. That wasn't fun.

This is actually my second time trying to make this repo. Not fun. I accidentally started tracking the entire game project folder instead of tracking the different folders inside the game project. I'm not sure if this is proper procedure, but this is for sure easier on me for now to really understand how git version control works.
Hopefully this time, it'll all go smoothly.

I also need to remember to format my readmes to look more readable at some point.
